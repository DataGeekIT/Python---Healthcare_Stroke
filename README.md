# Python Healthcare_Stroke - Project Overview

The goal of this project is to analyze stroke-related data contained in the file healthcare-dataset-stroke-data.csv. The results should be presented in the form of a report (e.g., RMarkdown, Jupyter Notebook), including both the code and explanations of the decisions made throughout the analysis. The analysis should include at least the following components:

1. Data cleaning – handling missing values (removal/imputation), correcting errors, transforming variables, and addressing outliers.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

3. Modeling – building at least three predictive models to estimate the stroke variable based on the remaining features.

4. Evaluation – assessing model performance on a test set, including selection of appropriate metrics and justification for the final model choice.
